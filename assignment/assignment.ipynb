        "\n",
        "Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper is about data tidying, ie making data easy to analyze and manipulate because they are formatted nicely in tables, columns, and rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together.\" (Wickham 1)\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The sentence \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" means that once a dataset is tidy, it is similar in format and structure. But, when datasets are messy, they can be any of a multitude of different types of messy. One messy dataset might have multiple rows for a certain observation that has different variable values for each row, while a different messy dataset might have one row for an observation, but have multiple values in one variable (eg 2 phone numbers). Other datasets might have missing values, extraneous columns, bad datatypes, typos, or a combination of all these problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sentence \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\" means that defining 'variables' and 'observations' in a concrete way for all possible datasets is not easy. You can say an observation is a 'unit,' but like we discussed with the shark attack data, is a unit a shark attack or a individual victim of the attack? Similarly, the text talks about how 'height' and 'width' could be variables for one dataset, but 'dimensions' could be a variable for a similar dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "According to Wickham, a value is either a number or a string that is assigned to a variable and an observation. A variable is an attribute of the data that contains all of the values of a specific attribute, while an observation is a unit of the data that contains all of the values of a specific unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"In tidy data: 1. Each variable forms a column. 2. Each observation forms a row. 3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.\" (Wickham 4)\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are: \"Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\" (Wickham 5)\n",
        "\n",
        "The data in Table 4 are messy because the column headers are value ranges, not variable names, and variables are both rows and columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Melting a dataset is turning columns of the dataset into rows, reformatting the data into new variables that more accurately describe the data. Usually this results in long data when some of the original observations look like they are repeated, but because the previous column headers have become values for a new variable, each observation is distinct.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "Table 11 is messy because variables are stored in both rows and columns. Table 12a is molten because it converted the d1-d31 columns into observations/rows and table 12b is tidy because it converted the element values into variables tmax and tmin, so thus each day unit is one observation with the attributes tmax and tmin instead of two observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The chicken and egg problem is that tidy data and tidy data tools are difficult to separate, and it is hard to improve one without improving the other. Wickham hopes that \"others will build on this framework to develop even better data storage strategies and better tools,\" and also that other frameworks will be developed to make other data cleaning tasks easier (Wickham 22).\n"
